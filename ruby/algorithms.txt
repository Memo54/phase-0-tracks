(Algorithm for my robot to use the Elevator)

- Walk towards the elevator doors, and stop approximately 1 foot away from the elevator doors:
    - Look to your left hand side, lift your arm at 45 degrees; bend your arm at 90 degrees.
    - Look at the elevator panel, there are 2 buttons one to go up; and one to go down.
    - Point your index finger, press the elevator button to go up.
- After pressing the button, lower your arm; wait until the elevator doors open.
- Once the elevator doors open, wait 5 seconds for any person to exit the elevator.
- After every person has exited the elevator:
    - You may proceed by walking 5 feet forwards into the elevator.
    - Turn around 180 degrees clockwise to face the elevator panel.
- Look at the elevator panel to your left hand side, lift your arm at 45 degrees; bend your arm at 90 degrees:
    - There are 45 buttons, one for each floor.
    - Point your index finger, press the button with the number 32 to go up to the 32nd floor.
- Wait patiently, the doors will close and the elevator will go up towards the 32nd floor
- The moment the elevator stops at the 32nd floor:
    - Once the elevator doors open, you may proceed to exit the elevator 5 feet forward.
    - After walking forward, turn 90 degrees to the right.
- And you may proceed to walk towards my room.
